## Data Cleaning & Transformation

This project exemplifies essential data cleaning and transformation techniques, empowering data analysts to derive optimal insights from raw data:

- **XLOOKUP for User Information Retrieval:** Employed XLOOKUP to efficiently locate user details like email addresses and usernames from separate worksheets based on user IDs, streamlining the process.
- **Conditional IF Statements with XLOOKUP to Address NULL:** Incorporated conditional IF statements alongside XLOOKUP to effectively remove zero values that XLOOKUP might leave behind, ensuring data accuracy.
- **INDEX & MATCH for Dynamic Lookups:** Leveraged INDEX and MATCH for the creation of dynamic lookups, enhancing flexibility and adaptability within the data analysis process.
- **Nested IF Statements for Column Renaming:** Implemented nested IF statements for transforming abbreviated column names into full, descriptive labels, improving clarity and readability.
- **Data Formatting for Calculations:** Enhanced data reliability by converting relevant columns into appropriate date and currency formats, paving the way for subsequent calculations.
- **Duplicate Removal:** Eliminated duplicate values from the dataset to guarantee data integrity and prevent skewed results in analyses.

## Data Analysis and Visualization for Deep Insights

- **PivotTable Construction:** Created a pivot table to uncover total sales trends across diverse time periods, categorized by the four different coffee bean types, revealing valuable patterns and sales drivers.
- **Grouping for Focused Analysis:** Utilized grouping techniques to isolate specific years and date values, facilitating targeted and granular exploration of the data.
- **Timeline and Slicer Integration:** Integrated a timeline and slicer functionality into the dashboard, granting users the power to intuitively filter data and pinpoint specific periods for deeper examination.
- **Time Series Visualization:** Conducted time series visualization analysis to uncover trends and patterns in sales over time, potentially revealing seasonal variations or other temporal influences.
- **Sales by Country Visualization:** Employed a column chart to vividly portray total sales figures across different countries, offering a geographical perspective on customer preferences.
- **Top Customers Chart:** Constructed a column chart highlighting the top five customers based on their total sales, enabling identification of valuable customer segments and potential areas for targeted marketing efforts.
